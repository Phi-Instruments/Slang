# Slang
Slang is a programming language with the focus on writing applications for audioprogramming and multimedia technology. It uses a main technique in that each buffer is calculated or modified from the code itself. It is also widely used to write the firmware for the eurorack modules from PhiLabs and GouodModules. All of Slang is written in ANSI C and thus runs on pretty much every plattform.
